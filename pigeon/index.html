    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Is a pigeon faster than the internet?</h2>
    <h2 style="font-size: 100%; text-align: center; min-width: 100%">YES!</h2>
    <p>Now, let me explain in a larger sense.  Most of our home networks are likely similar to mine, maybe around 50-100 megabits per second.  The world's fastest internet speed ever achieved is at <b>319 terabits per second</b>.  That record is held by some extremely devoted Japanese engineers.</p>
    <p>Most of us will likely never see those types of speeds in the home, so our goal will be to beat Google Fiber's fastest competition at <b><i>8 gigabits per second</i></b>.  </p>
    <p>Firstly, we must define a few key points.  A bit and a byte are two extremely different things.  It is likely you may have heard that 8 bits go into one byte.  That means that if we want to convert to and from the two units, we will have to multiply or divide.</p>
    <h3>Now, to start the main attraction, proving that a pigeon is faster than the internet.  </h3>
    <p>Long ago (and still, I suppose), homing pigeons could be used to deliver messages on parchment and paper to a recipient.  </p>
    <p>!!!IMAGE LATER!!! My Pigeon <--> Recipient's House !!!IMAGE LATER!!!</p>
    <p>As many of us have likely used, or at least heard of, e-mail is very similar in this fashion where you write a message and send it off.  In order to send a sizable file over an e-mail, however, you would have to host it on a cloud service due to the technical size limitations of e-mail.  You <i>could</i> send a flash drive or something like it through the postal service, but that takes an extreme amount of time.  </p>
    <p>As we've just covered, a cloud service or mailing a flash drive may not make sense.  This is because if I pay for <i>100 megabits per second</i> internet on both the sending and receiving end or the file, the hypothetical maximum speed is going to be <i>12.5 megabytes per second</i> (which never actually happens).  For a <i>1 gigabyte file</i>, that would equate to about <i>82 seconds</i> to upload and another 82 seconds to download.  These speeds are not feasible however because on most 100 megabit internet, you never actually get to take full advantage of that 12.5 megabytes speed due to other devices on the network.  </p>
    <p>Thus, as we have it so far, we know that the internet is extremely slow for everyone.  Having actually simulated this test digitally, it takes about eight-and-a-half minutes fully automated (<i>Google Drive upload then download - 100 Mbps both ways</i>).  That's pretty slow.  We also now know that every mailing a <i>1 terabyte</i> flash drive across the country, if it were to take seven days to be shipped would equate to <i>13.8 megabytes per second</i> plus the extra time required to take the file off of the flash drive could take upwards of a half-an-hour to copy the file.</p>
    <p>Now, for the fun part, the pigeon.  Let's say that this pigeon can travel <i><250 miles/i> in a day.  We can add more days to this journey as well, but or simplicity, let's choose one day.</p>
    <p>Our hypothetical pigeon's name is Wayne.  Say hello to Wayne!  Wayne is like the pigeon described above, he could fly from Concord, New Hampshire to New York City, New York (267 miles).  Wayne is a well-trained pigeon that can carry about 2.25 ounces on his back.  <i>Technically</i>, we could have Wayne hold a four terabyte 2.5" SSD and that would average out to about 350 megabytes per second accounting for the transfer time to a computer.</p>
    <p>However, what's important is that Wayne doesn't need to carry the bulky four terabyte SSD.  We can instead use Wayne to carry a parcel of <i>two-hundred-and-fifty-five 1.5 terabyte micro SD cards</i>.  After traveling the <i>250 miles</i> and grabbing the data, it would average out to about <i>4,427 megabytes per second</i>.  Thus, being faster than most of our home internet and four times faster than our initial goal of beating Google Fiber...  </p>
    <h3>Extra Fun Time: Let's beat the fastest internet!</h3>
    <p>If we were to use all of Wayne's potential, we should be able to squeeze a maximum of <i>450 terabytes</i> of data on a single pigeon.  That's the bottleneck: 450 terabytes per pigeon.  The fastest internet infrastructure is stuck at that 39.9 terabytes (319 terabits) per second.  Thus, we could technically keep sending out pigeons every half hour or so and keep reloading data onto SD cards when the pigeons com back every few days or so.  </p>

    <h3>There you have it!  Pigeons are wonderful and seemingly infinitely versatile.  However, most of our pockets aren't that deep!</h3>
